# CS3332-Project
(FYI, not sure why some of my changes were coming through my alt Github account "poptharty", but I have now fixed that, sorry guys) 

Group project for software development class. 
To be a collaborator on this project, you must pull the project to your own device as a start. Refer to the video tutorial if you are unsure. :D
From there, you can use whichever text editor you would like. VSC, Sublime, etc.

Main branch is our completed and working branch.
dev branch is a final testing space before merging to main.
Subsequent branches should be created from dev, pulled frequently, and tested before merging to dev.
